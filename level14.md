In this challenge you're supposed to submit the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

This means that telnet comes into play.

The telnet command gives a two way interactive text-oriented communication with another host using the TELNET protocol.

The other host in this case is the localhost

Note: The fact that you had to paste the password is a catch since from level 13 you could directly move to level 14 by sshing. This means you actually have to read the bandit14 file




command: telnet localhost 30000
then:    paste level 14's password and press enter




password for level 15: BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
