In this level we're supposed to look for a file with certain characteristics.

Ideally it should have all of them but I thought that size was the most critical so I searched primarily using that. I got lucky since there was only one file with a size of 1033 bytes. Note that bytes are the same as characters(c)

Since we're searching for a file we need to find it based on the given characteristics




command: find -size 1033c
         cat

-size means search according to the size given

Note that the file given contains a . at the beginning meaning it is a hidden file
