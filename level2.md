In this level we need to read a file that contains spaces in its filename.

There are 2 ways to do this:
    Convert the file name into a string since spaces aren't that much of a big deal in strings
    Or escape the spaces to tell bash that this is one word




command: cat "spaces in this filename"
         cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
